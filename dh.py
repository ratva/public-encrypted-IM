Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Program

This program demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm over a network.
It allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret key without any prior communication.

Usage:
- Run this program on both the client and server machines.
- The client and server will exchange public keys and compute the shared secret key.
- The shared secret key can then be used for secure communication.
